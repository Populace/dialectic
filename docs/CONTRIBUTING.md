# Contributing

All contributions are gratefully considered. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/marcelkornblum/dialectic/fork), follow the [license](../LICENSE) and [standards](./STANDARDS.md), and make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/marcelkornblum/dialectic/pulls) to submit changes back to the main repo.

## Pull Requests

Merging into the `develop` and `master` branches should always be done via a Pull Request, which should be reviewed for usefulness and following standards including documentation and test coverage, and approved by a contributor other than the submitter.

Each pull request should address a single issue or feature, and should contain a description making clear the purpose and the reasoning behind the request, referencing issue numbers where possible.

First-time contributors please feel welcome, but expect your code to be reviewed and coommented upon, possibly with amendments being required before your PR is accepted.

## Issues and Roadmap

The [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/marcelkornblum/dialectic/issues) system is enabled for this project and is intended to be a developer-centric, open access issue list where anyone can raise issues about the codebase, including minor enhancement requests.

Major features are explored on the [project wiki](https://github.com/marcelkornblum/dialectic/wiki), and added to a Pivotal Tacker project as epics and stories. If you're interested in contributing, please get in touch to get access to the tracker.
